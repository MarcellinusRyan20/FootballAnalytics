# FootballAnalytics
This project uses data from Football Manager to build a team profile at season's end, identifying areas for improvement. By combining statistical analysis and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the study aims to pinpoint players who provide optimal value based on performance metrics, guiding player acquisition and disposals.
